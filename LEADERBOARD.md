## 3. Daily AI4Science & SciML Research Radar (arXiv Pulse)

Automated surveillance of newly published preprints covering Neural Operators, PINN improvements, and high-performance PDE solvers as of **2026-10-30 03:40 UTC**:

### 1. [Linear-Stability-Guided Two-Stage Surrogate Model for Nonlinear ITG-TEM Turbulence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2610.39381v1)
- **Authors**: Y. W. Cho, C. G. Wan, Z. S. Qu et al. (2026-10-29)

- **Authors**: Ehsan Roohi, Christopher J. McDevitt (2026-10-28)
- **Abstract Takeaway**: Deep lid-driven cavities contain strong motion beneath the lid and much weaker recirculation at depth, so agreement in bulk velocity is an incomplete assessment of a computed flow. We examine data-fre...
